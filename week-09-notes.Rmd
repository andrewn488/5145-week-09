# 09-01: MongoDB Operators, Part 1

## MongoDB Operator Overview

+ doing queries with operators (comparisons, logicals, etc.) to filter the information

![](sqlvsmql.png)

+ MongoDB Queries

    + Extra attention is needed for: 
        + Documents that may not have fields to evaluate
            + Dynamic schema
            + Extra checks in queries are required
        + The order of processing affects performance
            + SQL DBMS more automated than NoSQL system
            + NoSQL environment needs skills around reviewing query plans
            + Fewer automated DBMS features
            + Reviewing query plans is a manual effort
        + Indexing is more important
            + Order of indexing can yield better performance
            + Distributed data makes data harder to find
            + Database designers are needed more often

+ Operators - perform effective filtering

    + Comparisons
    + Logical
    + Array
    + Evaluation/expressions (Regular Expressions)
    + Elements
    
+ CRUD

    + Insert
    + Update
    + Delete
    + Find and modify

## Operators and BSON

+ Operators == Comparisons
+ BSON <- MongoDB's layer to interpret JSON type

+ Operators - for comparison of different BSON type values

    + $eq <- matches values that are equal to a specified value
    + $gt <- matches values that are greater than a specified value
    + $gte <- matches values that are greater than or equal to a specified value
    + $in <- matches any of the values specified in an array
    + $lt <- matches values that are less than a specified value
    + $lte <- matches values that are less than or equal to a specified value
    + $ne <- mathes all values that are not equal to a specified value
    + $nin <- matches none of the values specified in an array
    
+ BSON Type Values

    + MongoDB's layer of interpreting JSON data
    + BSON is MOngoDB specific (Binary-JSON)
        + it is how MOngoDB stores JSON documents
        + more efficient storage process - uses less space since binary
        + provides faster and more robust indexing
            + native JSON stuff not setup for heavy duty indexing
        + adds metadata to store and retrieve data quickly
        + adds support for other data types 
            + date for chronological comparisons
            + binary
            
+ Why BSON is important

    + $type operator
        + evaluates what type the data is
        + all data can be identified by a specific BSON type
        + Helps with queries and writing code
        + ensure operators succeed
    + when doing comparisons, must do like for like
        + must compare integer with integer
        + must compare daet with date
        + must do conversions in order for queries to work
        
## $eq Operator

+ most powerful of operators
    
    + able to look at fields, sub-documents, fields within sub-documents, and arrays
    
![](eq_01.png)


+ $eq - Field

    + compares equality
      {<field>: {eq: <value>}}
    + Example
      db.students.find({age:{$eq:33}});
      db.students.find({age:33});  # both equivalent statements
    + default comparison is $eq

+ $eq - Embedded Document

    + Addressed the same as a field
    + Example
      db.students.find({"item.name":{$eq: "Rosie"}})
      db.students.find({"item.name":"Rosie"})
      
+ $eq - Array Element

    + Finds a match within an array
        + Documents where the <array> contains the <value>
    + Example
        db.students.find({tags:{$eq: "Biking}})
        db.students.find({tags:"Biking"})
    + "Scan all elements in an array. If any of them are "Biking", return that document"
    + Finds a match with an array
        + Documents where <array> matches the <value> array exactly
        + Elements and order
        db.students.find({tags:["Biking", "Skiing"]})
            + must be in the same order, and the only elements in the array
            + must be very specific when working with arrays

## $gt, $gte, $lt, $lte, $ne Operators

+ Comparisons work exactly as expected
+ Syntax:

    + {<field>: {$gt:<value>}}
    + {<field>: {$gte:<value>}}
    + {<field>: {$lt:<value>}}
    + {<field>: {$lte:<value>}}
    + {<field>: {$ne:<value>}}
    
+ works find for fields and with sub-document.fields
+ does NOT work for arrays
+ <field> type and <value> type must match, or be converted to match

+ $ne - Field

    + Example
      db.students.find({item.major: {$ne: "French"}})
    + Returns true if not equal
    + Also returns true if <field> DOES NOT EXIST
    + Can be used to find non-empty arrays
      db.students.find({tags:{$ne:[]}})
      "returns all documents where tags: array actually have values to them" 


## $in, $nin Pattern Matching Operators

+ Finds field matches in a value array

    + {<field>:{$in: [<value1>, <value2>...]}}
    + Example
      db.students.find({age:{$in:[45, 46, 47]}});
      db.students.find({item.major:{$in:["Teaching", "French"]}})
      
+ $in - Array

    + Finds array field matches in a value array
        + the either/or scenario we need
    {<field>:{$in:[<value1>, <value2>...]}}
    + Example
        db.students.find({tags:{$in:["Skiing", "Biking"]}});
        "Will find all students where the tags array has an element that matches **EITHER** Skiing or Biking

+ $in - Partial Match

    + finds field matching a partial string value
        + Called pattern matching
        + provides the LIKE functionality
        + /pattern/<options>   # the "/" replaces quotes
        + ^ <- start
        + $ <- end
        + m <- each line for multiline strings
        + i <- ignores case
        db.students.find({item.major:{$in:[/^T/, /$B/]}});
        db.students.find({item.major:{$in:[/^T/i]}});
        db.students.find({item.name:{$in:[/and//i]}});  # looking for 'and' somewhere within the string, regardless of case
        
+ $nin - Field

    + Finds fields and arrays that do NOT match any items in a value array
    + finds documents where the <field> does not exist
    + {<field>:{$nin: [<value1>, <value2>...]}}
      db.students.find({age:{$nin:[45, 46, 47]}});
      db.students.find({item.major:{$nin:["Teaching", "French"]}})
        


# MongoDB Operators, Part 2

## Hands on Operators

+ Allow all IP addresses to access DB
+ practice \$gt, \$gte, \$eq, \$lt, \$lte, \$in

## $and, $or Logical Operators

+ practice in Studio 3T
+ MQL loves **arrays**
+ evaluation type goes in front of the array
+ comparison operators managed in **ARRAYs**

    + must meet all criteria with $and
    db.students.find(
      {$and:[{age: {$gte: 40},
              {item.major: {$in: ["Teaching", "French"]}},
              {item.name: {$eq: "Andrew"}}
              ]}
    )
    
    + must meet any criteria with $or
    db.students.find(
      {$or:[{age: {$gte: 40},
              {item.major: {$in: ["Teaching", "French"]}},
              {item.name: {$eq: "Andrew"}}
              ]}
    )

+ $and

    + performs a logical AND operation on an array of one or more expressions
    + returns documents that match ALL expressions
        {$and: [{<expression1>}, {<expression2>},...]}
        
+ $or

    + performs a logical OR operation on an array of one or more expressions
    + returns documents that match AT LEAST 1 expression
        {$or: [{<expression1>}, {<expression2>},...]}
        
+ syntax and structure easy to follow if get into mindset of thinking of everything as an ARRAY


## $nor, $not Logical Operators

+ $nor

    + Performs a logical NOR operation on an array of one or more expressions
    + Returns documents that do not match ALL expressions
    + only matters where it doesn't match all the criteria
    + **so why use an expression at all if $nor just looks at the field existing or not?** - QUESTION
    
+ $not

    + Performs a logical NOT operation on an EXPRESSION (not an ARRAY)
    + Returns documents that do not match the expression
    + Dynamic schema:
        + Age less than 40 OR "age" field does not exist
        + Not the same, because the "age" field must exist

## Array Operators

+ working with NoSQL, you must learn how to query ARRAYs

+ Array Operators:

    + $eq - has to be THESE elements in THIS order
    + $ne
    + $all - has to be THESE elements in ANY order
    + $elemmatch
    + $in - has to be ONE OR MORE elements in ANY order
    + $nin
    + $size
    + $location
    
![](student_collection.png)

+ order within the array matters --> ORDER SENSITIVE, number of elements sensitive

+ Array single comparison

    + finds a match within an array
        + documents where an <array> elements contains the <value>
    + Example
        db.students.find({grades:{$gt:90}})
        + All students with at least one grades element that is > 90
        
+ $eq - Array multiple comparison

    + Finds a match with an array
        + Documents where the <array> matches the <value> array exactly
        + Elements and Order sensitive
        db.students.find({tags:{$eq:["Biking", "Skiing"]}})
        + Students whose tags array matches "Biking" and "Skiing" as the first two elements in that order
        
+ $all - Array multiple comparison
    
    + Finds a match with an array
        + Documents where the <array> matches the <value> array values in ANY order
        db.students.find({tags:{$all:["Biking", "Skiing"]}})
        + Students whose tags array contains elements that match "Biking" and "Skiing" in any order
        
+ Array multiple conditions - $elemMatch

    + Multiple conditions applied against multiple array items
    db.students.find({grades:{$gte: 80, $lt: 90}})
    + Any combination of elements can satisfy the condition. One grade is >= 80 and another grade is < 90
    + Comparison on each element of an array individually: 
    db.students.find({grades:{$elemMatch: {$gte: 80, $lt: 90}}})
    + At least one elemtn in the grades array is >= 80 and < 90

+ $eq - Empty Array

    + used to find empty arrays
    db.students.find({tags:{$eq:[]}})
    + All students with an empty tags array, BUT
        + only if the tags field exists
        
+ $ne - Not empty Array

    + Returns documents where the aray field is NOT empty
    db.students.find({tags:{$ne:[]}})
    + All students who have values in the tags array
    
+ $in - Array

    + Finds documents where any <array> element matches any items the comparison array
    + Only works for documents where the <array> exists
    db.students.find({tags:{$in:["Skiing", "Biking"]}})
    + All studnets where the tags array has an element that matches either "Skiing" or "Biking"
    
+ $nin - Array

    + Finds docuemnts where the <array> elements do NOT match any items the comparison array
    + Finds documents where the <array> does not exist
    db.students.find({tags:{$nin:["Skiing", "Biking"]}})
    + All students where the tags array DOES NOT have EITHER "Skiing" or "Biking" or where the tags array is not used
    
+ Array element location

    + Finds a match with a specific element in the array
    + Uses a zerio (0) based array count
    db.students.find({tags.1:{$eq:"Biking"}})  "tags.1 indicates tags array position 2"
    + Students whose second tags element matches "Biking"
    
+ Array size

    + Finds a match with arrays that match a specific number of elements
    db.students.find({tags:{$size:3}})
    + Students who have 3 elements in tags array


# MongoDB Aggregate, Part 1

## Aggregation Kickoff

+ Aggregation pipelines
+ Aggregation

    + Set the stage to summarize data
    + Aggregate:
        + list total sales by customer for California
        + Calculate average sales and net profit for each product group and product
        + Show the average nightly rental cost for 3-bedroom properties on Maui
    + Update:
        + Set letter grade based on calculated GPA
        + Update all inventory on hands totals, based on today's manufacturing and shipment totals
    + Aggregation operations <- series of steps that process documents
        + Return completed results
            + Results can be scalar or datasets
            + Same as SQL Server
        + Update data, based on results
    + Methods
        + Aggregation pipeline
        + Single-purpose aggregation
        + Map-reduce functions - **Final Exam**
            + works with systems that handle unstructured big data

+ Map-Reduce

    + Data processing paradigm
        + condensing large volumes of data
            + reduces it down to something we can work with
        + delivers aggregated results
    + Map-Reduce
        + Used in Big Data solutions
        + Relies on distributed processing (sharded)
        + Operations
            + Map <- specifies data elements and aggregation
            + Reduce <- filters and summarizes
            + takes multiple stages
            + SQL Server optimizes the query plan
            + MongoDB does not optimize. Up to the analyst!


## Aggregate Pipeline Overview

+ Aggregation Pipeline

    + Based on data processing pipelines
        + Data goes through a series of "stages"
        + Transforms the data into new documents in each stage
        + Each stage uses the output of the previous stage as a new collection
        + **sequential process** - only works from top down - EXAM
        + each stage modifies the data, creating a new collection
    + Developer takes on the responsibility of designing stages in the most optimal way
        + Compared to SQL Server which creates a query optimization plan on its own
        + SQL <- already pre-optimized
        + MQL <- analyst must plan to optimize
    + **Pipelines can contain multiple stages
        + More like programming than querying** - EXAM
        + perform discrete operations at different points
    + Aggregate function uses array of stages
        
![](sqlvsmql_02.png)

+ $group

    + in a document collection, _id is mandatory
    + _id: "$customer.name" <- define new ID called "customer.name"
    + whenever we use a group or a function in an aggregate, must refer to a field name with $
    + $ <- "use this field name" 
    
+ More than Query

    + Aggregation is more than GROUP BY
        + sophisticated and complex processing
        + multi-stage processing
        + accumulating, but also modifying data
    + Focus: 
        + Set Expression Operators
        + Accumulators ($group)
        + Accumulators (in Other Stages)
    + We have single documents with LOTS of stuff in them
    + Focus: 
        + $match <- filter documents
        + $group <- summarize documents
        + $project <- reshape documents
        + $unwind <- expand arrays in documents
        
![](pipeline_operators.png)

## $match

+ pipelines commonly begin with filtering the data

+ $match

    + explicitly denotes a filtering expression
        + the first evaluation in .find()
        db.students.find({tags:{$eq:"Biking}})
        db.students.aggregate(
          [
          {$match:{tags:{$eq:"Biking}}}  # stage 1
          ]
        )
    + Can use all the same operators (and more...)
    db.students.aggregate(
      [
        {$match:{$and:
          [{age:{$gte: 40},
            {item.major:{$in:["teaching", "French"]}},
            {item.name:{$eq: "Andrew"}}}
            ]}
            }
      ]
    )
    + NOTE: stages can appear multiple times
    db.students.aggregate(
      [
      {$match: {age: {$gte: 40}},  # stage 1
      {$match: {major: {$in: ["Teaching", "French"]}},  # stage 2
      {$match: {item.name:{$eq: "Andrew}}  # stage 3
      }}}
      ]
    )
    + each stage goes through entire collection 
    + single stage query only goes through collection once


## $group

+ very similar to GROUP BY in SQL
+ Accumulators <- SQL Aggregation

+ $group

    + for arithmetic processing
    + non-arithmetic processing
    + Specific syntax is required ("$fieldname")
    + Similar to SQL
    + need unique identifier to group fields on
    + must think about how document structure will end up
    
+ $sum - Example

![](sum-example.png)

    + must specify new field names in the result set document
    + if no $, MQL assumes literal

+ \$sum - \$avg - Example

    db.sales.aggregate(
      [{$group:
        {_id: "$customer.name",
          totalsales: {$sum: "$order.amount"},
          avgsales: {$avg: "$order.amount"},
          avgrate: {$avg: {
            $divide: {"$order.amount", "$order.quantity"}}}
      }]
      );
      
+ practice in Studio 3T


## $unwind

+ subdocuments need special handling

    + Array of documents
    + must be opened up (unwind())
    + $unwind stage
    + makes as many rows as sub items in the sub-document
    
+ $unwind - Example

    db.sales.aggregate(
      [{$unwind: $items}  # must specify which field you wish to unwind sub-docs
      {$group:
        {_id: "$storeLocation",
        totalsales:{$sum:
                      {$multiply:
                        ["$items.quantity", "$items.price"]}}
          }
          }
      ]
    )


# MongoDB Aggregate, Part 2


## $push and $addFields

+ \$group, \$push, \$addfields
+ helps to build document how you want it to look like

+ $push - Example

    db.sales.aggregate(
      [{$group:
          {_id: "$customer.state",
          customers:{$push:"$customer.name"}}
          }]
    );
    + pushing the customer names into an array field
    + $push kind of like an accumulater 
    + $push builds an array of evaluators
    + taking the dataset and structuring as documents as you wish
    + $push only works within $group
    
+ \$addFields <- just like mutate()
+ practice in Studio 3T
+ in a NoSQL environment, fields don't have to exist
    

## $project

+ similar to $find
+ much more capabilities while using \$project within an \$aggregation pipeline
+ $project in Aggregation

    + Can simply specify fields to include in the output
    + Also: 
        + Include / exclude fields from the previous stage
        + Include / exclude fields based on conditions
        + Rename fields
        + Create new array fields
    + Only works with fields passed to it
    
![](project_01.png)

![](project_02.png)

+ if student's middle name is blank or doesn't exist, then REMOVE, else use the student's middle name

![](project_03.png)

## CRUD

+ CRUD is fundamental to all DB systems
+ CRUD <- Insert, Update, Delete, Find and Modify
+ Modifying documents
    
    + No field enforcement
    + Up to the application or analyst to ensure data is correct
    
+ $insertOne

    + inserts one new document into the collection
    + up to you to ensure correct fields are included with correct information

+ $insertMany

    + inserts many documents
    + must be diligent on spelling and nomenclature
    
![](update.png)

![](findAndModify.png)


## Scalar

+ Single Purpose (Scalar-ish)

    + Simple processes for aggregation from a single collection.
        + .estimatedDocumentCount()
            + Returns document count without a filter
        + .count()
            + Returns document count that would match a .find() query
        + .distinct()
            + Returns distinct list, based on field specified
    + Scalar <- returns *a* value (singular)
    
+ Real Scalar

    + Producing a single value is controlled by the developer/analyst using a regular aggregation pipeline
    db.sales.aggregate(
      [
      { $unwind: $items},
      { $project: totalsales: { $sum: "$items.amount"}}
      ]);

+ $concat
    
    + Join 2 or more strings
    db.inventory.aggregate([
      { $project: {descrip:
        { $concat: ["$item", "-", "$description"]}
        }}
    ])
    + '$' denotes "grab the field, not the str literal"
    
+ $convert

    + if possible, converts an input to a desired output type
    + Includes onError and onNull values
    db.inventory.aggregate([
      { $addFields: {
        convertedPrice: {
          $convert: {
          input: "$price", to: "decimal", 
          onError: "Error",  # insert this string literal if an error is encountered
          onNull: NumberDecimal("0")  # if null, replace with 0
          }
        }
      }}
    ])

+ $ifNull

    + Evaluates an expression and returns the value if non-null or the replacement value if null
    db.inventory.aggregate([
      { $project: {descrip: 
        { $ifNull: ["$description", "Unspecified"]}
        }}
    ])

## Export Import

+ we are now able to extract information from MongoDB
+ Now that we have the data, what do we do with it?
+ export stuff into different formats
